# PANEL5 -  A library for creating panel based UI with p5.js

__Ever wanted to create smooth UIs in p5.js? No? Yeah that makes sense.__ I created this in tandem with my __Very Particular Particle Playground__ project as a solution to an editing UI for the playground elements. Its a very messy project and is poorly optimized, but _womp womp_.

It works using a central __UI__ wrapper that handles the creation, removal, and updating of panels __(draggable elements that can display content)__. It utilizes a __Registry__ system to create editable properties, meaning you can assign colors, sizes, names, etc... to a registry and have it be editable in a panel. 

I really don't want to explain all of this and proper document it. So, if you really are curious, most of the functions and such in the code have comments explaining their purpose. Have fun...
